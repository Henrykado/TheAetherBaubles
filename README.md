A compatibility mod/addon that removes The Aether's accessory menu and replaces every accessory with new Baubles versions of each of them.

The mod also adds configuration options to remove certain accessory types (like gloves, pendants, etc), an option to change the Baubles type that gloves use (RING by default), one to enable equip sounds, and one to change pendants' display name so they are referred to as amulets.
